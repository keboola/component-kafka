The Kafka Extractor subscribes to selected topics and saves the messages to Keboola by creating one table per topic and appending each message as a new row.
It supports text, Avro, and JSON (schemaless) payloads.

More information about the functionality and how to configure component it can be found in the [documentation](https://github.com/keboola/component-kafka/blob/master/components/ex-kafka/README.md).
